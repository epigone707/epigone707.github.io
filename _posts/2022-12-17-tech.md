# Intro to Rouge
[Rouge](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge) is a syntax highlighter written in Ruby to provide syntax highlighting for code written on HTML pages. According to [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.5/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#syntax-highlighting),

> By default, code blocks on your site will be highlighted by Jekyll. Jekyll uses the Rouge highlighter, which is compatible with Pygments. Pygments has been deprecated and not supported in Jekyll 4. If you specify Pygments in your _config.yml file, Rouge will be used as the fallback instead. Jekyll cannot use any other syntax highlighter, and you'll get a page build warning if you specify another syntax highlighter in your _config.yml file.

In this article, we will use Rouge (syntax highlighter), [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) (Markdown parser) and Jekyll to build our blog. Since Rouge and Kramdown are now default setting, you don't need to specify them in your `_config.yml`, but if you want to, add following code into it. 

```yml
markdown: kramdown
kramdown:
  syntax_highlighter: rouge
```

# Syntax Highlighting

## Pick a Theme
First, add a syntax highlighting CSS into your project. Here I pick github style. 
```shell
$ rougify style github > css/github-style.css
```
Include the CSS file in your `head.html`.
```html
<link href="/css/github-style.css" rel="stylesheet" >
```
You can find your favorite theme in this [page](https://spsarolkar.github.io/rouge-theme-preview/).

## Write Your Code Block

We write posts in markdown files, and Jekyll will generate HTML for us.
In your markdown file, add following javascript code block:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% highlight javascript %}
document.write("JavaScript is a simple language for javatpoint learners");
alert("This is a test");
{% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The resulted post would show javascript syntax highlighting.

{% highlight javascript %}
document.write("JavaScript is a simple language for javatpoint learners");
alert("This is a test");
{% endhighlight %}

Instead of liguid tags, we can also use markdown sytax. In your markdown file, add following javascript code block:
~~~
```javascript
document.write("JavaScript is a simple language for javatpoint learners");
alert("This is a test");
```
~~~

The resulted post would be the same
```javascript
document.write("JavaScript is a simple language for javatpoint learners");
alert("This is a test");
```

Of course, you can modify `javascript` to be other languages. 


## Enable Line Number

You can add line number to your code block by specifying the `linenos` option. In your markdown file, add following javascript code block:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% highlight javascript linenos%}
document.write("JavaScript is a simple language for javatpoint learners");
alert("This is a test");
{% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The resulted code block would show line numbers.

{% highlight javascript linenos%}
document.write("JavaScript is a simple language for javatpoint learners");
alert("This is a test");
{% endhighlight %}

You can set showing line numbers to be default setting in your `_config.yml`. Add following code into it.

```yml 
markdown: kramdown
kramdown:
  syntax_highlighter: rouge
  syntax_highlighter_opts:
    block:
      line_numbers: true
```

## Escape Liquid Tags
If you have [liquid tags](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/tags) in your code block, the resulting html may look weird. We need to escape liquid tags by using `raw` tag. See this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3426182/how-to-escape-liquid-template-tags).


## Rounded Corners, Padding and Horizontal Scrollbar

You may notice that (1) the corners of the code block are right angles; (2) the padding is too small; (3) if the line is too long, the code can run out of block. I wrote some simple CSS codes to address these issues. Add following code into `thankful-style.css`.

```css
/* 
    add rounded corners, padding syntax and horizontal scroll bar to the code block
    author: epigone707
*/
pre.highlight {
  padding: 7px;
  /* cause a scrolling mechanism to be provided for overflowing boxes */
  overflow-x: auto; 
}

figure.highlight>pre {
  padding: 7px;
  overflow-x: auto;
}

.highlight {
  border-radius: 5px;
}
```

Now the code block is nice and neat.

```python
def foo(name):
  print("this is really long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long sentence.")
  return
```
