I'm Yanfu and I'm currently a Solo Rank Diamond 1 player in League of Legends. I play games (especially PVP games like CSGO, Valorant), read manga (especially JP and KR), write novels (never published cuz they're all shit) and watch anime (of course JP animes, 99% Chinese animes are similar to my novels).
