I'm Yanfu and I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at [Umich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan). I also have two bachelor's degrees: an ECE degree from [SJTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Jiao_Tong_University) and a CS degree from Umich... 

Alright, that is boring. 

I'm Yanfu and I'm currently a Solo Rank Diamond 1 player in League of Legends. I play games (especially PVP games like CSGO, Valorant), read manga (especially Japan and Korea), write novels (never published cuz they're all shit) and watch anime (of course Japanese animes. Chinese animes are 99% similar to my novels).

Have fun! Enjoy the short life of our human beings! Woooooo!
