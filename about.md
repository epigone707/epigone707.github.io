I'm Yanfu and I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I have two bachelor's degrees: an ECE degree from Shanghai Jiaotong University and a CS degree from the University of Michigan... 

Wait this is really boring why am I saying this here?

Alright, I'm Yanfu and I'm currently a Solo Rank Diamond 1 player in League of Legends. I play games (especially PVP games), read manga(especially Japan and Korea), write novels(never established cuz they're all shit) and watch anime(OC Japan).
