I'm Yanfu and I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at [Umich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan). I also have two bachelor's degrees: an ECE degree from [SJTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Jiao_Tong_University) and a CS degree from Umich... 

Alright, that is boring. 

I'm Yanfu and I'm currently a Solo Rank Diamond 1 player in League of Legends. I play games (especially PVP games like CSGO, Valorant), read manga (especially Japan and Korea), write novels (never published cuz they're all shit) and watch anime (of course Japanese animes, 99% Chinese animes are similar to my novels).

Have fun! Enjoy the short life of our human beings! Woooooo!
