# epigone707.github.io

This is my personal website built with jekyll. The link is https://epigone707.github.io/about/


## Build
Since Jekyll is a static site generator, it has to build the site before we can view it. Run either of the following commands to build your site:


`jekyll build` - Builds the site and outputs a static site to a directory called _site.

`jekyll serve` - Does jekyll build and runs it on a local web server at http://localhost:4000, rebuilding the site any time you make a change.

## Make your own website

see my [post](https://epigone707.github.io/tech/2022/07/25/tech.html)
